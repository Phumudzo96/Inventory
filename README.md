# Introduction

o Create a ﬁle named inventory.py, where a Shoe class should be
deﬁned.

o In the Shoe class, create a function (read_data()) that will
implement a try-except block for reading the following information
f rom the ﬁle:

● country,
● code,
● product,
● cost, and
● quantity.

o Create at least 5 shoe objects and store these in a list. Add
functionality to search products in the objects list by code.

o Write code to determine the product with the lowest quantity, and
restock it.

o Write code to determine the product with the highest quantity and
mark it up as being for sale.

o You will have noticed that in the original data, there are only ﬁve
columns. Write a function, value_per_item(), to calculate the value
(or total worth) of each item entered. (Please keep the formula for
value in mind; value = cost * quantity.) This function should then
create a sixth column for each product, named value.

o Represent the data f rom the objects list in a table format using
Python’s tabulate module, with the new value column added.
